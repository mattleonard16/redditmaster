C1,P1,,"I totally get your struggle! I recently tried out this AI presentation maker called Slideforge, and it really helped me turn rough outlines into polished slides in a fraction of the time. The cool thing is that it offers customizable templates which can make your deck look super professional without the usual hassle. Just a heads up though, the initial setup took a bit of time to get used to, but once I figured it out, it was a game changer for my workflow!",emily_econ,2025-12-15 09:18,
C2,P2,,"I've had some great luck with Slideforge for quick pitch decks. It has this smart AI feature that helps generate layouts based on just a few bullet points. I find it especially handy for last-minute presentations, but it might take a bit of tweaking to get the style just right for your brand. Definitely worth checking out if you're in a pinch!",emily_econ,2025-12-16 14:27,
C3,P3,,"I've found that tools like Canva have been a lifesaver for creating quick, visually appealing presentations. The drag-and-drop interface is super intuitive, and they have a ton of templates to help you get started. I recently used it to put together a pitch deck in just a couple of hours – way faster than PowerPoint for me! Just a heads-up though, while it’s great for design, you might still want something for more advanced data visualization. For that, I turned to Slideforge, which helped me convert my rough notes into a structured format rapidly. Definitely worth checking out!",priya_pm,2025-12-17 18:59,
